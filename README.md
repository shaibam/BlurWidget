# BlurWidget
exporting of focused circle on blured image assignment
Written in vanilla JS, using the easelJS canvas library.
the code is a bit messsy, because of lack of time, baby background cries and overall lack of mental focus.

Notes:

* If nodeJS is installed, this can be easily tested using :
 ```npm install http-server -g ```
  ```http-server ```
